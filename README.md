# AI-Course Repository
📌 Purpose of This Course
This repository is created to store and showcase all the practical works, assignments, and mini-projects completed during the AI course. The main goal of the course was to help students understand core AI concepts and apply them through hands-on programming tasks.

💡 What I Learned
During this course, I gained practical knowledge of key AI techniques such as:

Search algorithms: BFS, DFS, Best-First Search, AO*

Game-playing algorithms: Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning

Application of these algorithms in simple games like Tic-Tac-Toe and Nim

Introduction to real-world AI tools used for automation and content generation

These experiences helped me better understand how AI can be applied to solve real problems.
