# AI-Course Repository
This repository includes the projects I completed during my AI course at North East University Bangladesh. It was a hands-on course where I learned how different AI algorithms work and how they can be used in real applications like games.

I worked on search algorithms like BFS, DFS, Best-First Search, and AO*, and also learned about game-playing techniques like Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning. I used these to create simple AI-based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe and Nim.

Besides coding, I also got introduced to modern AI tools and how they’re used in tasks like automation and content creation. Overall, this course helped me gain both theoretical and practical knowledge in AI.
