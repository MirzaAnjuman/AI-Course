# ♟️ Chess Game – Player vs Computer (Minimax AI)

## 📁 Folder: `AI Games`

---

## 🛠️ How to Run

Make sure you have **Python** and the required libraries installed.

```bash
python chess_game.py
```

---

## 📦 Requirements

* Python 3.x
* `pygame` library
* `python-chess` library

Install the necessary libraries using:

```bash
pip install pygame python-chess
```

---

## 🎮 How to Play

* The game opens a graphical chess board.
* You play as **White**, and the **Computer (AI)** plays as Black.
* Click on a piece to select it. Legal moves will be highlighted with green dots.
* Click on a destination square to move the selected piece.
* The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning** to decide its move.
* The game ends with a proper display of **win/loss/draw** messages.

## 🧠 Algorithm Used

* **Minimax Algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta Pruning**
* Evaluation function based on **material balance** of the board
* AI search depth: 2 (can be modified for difficulty)
